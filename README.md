# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Craig, a Senior Full Stack Engineer with a strong focus on Cloud Native development.

### About Me

With years (and years ðŸ‘´) of experience across agencies, startups, and established organizations, I consider myself an accomplished generalist. I've had the privilege of working with various technologies, starting from the Flash/Flex era to Ruby, and nowadays, I dedicate most of my time to TypeScript and the vast JavaScript ecosystem, all while leveraging the capabilities of the cloud and tending to my homelab (or digital garden as i prefer to call it)

### Embracing the Power of AI

What truly excites me though is the ever-evolving field of AI & LLMs. I believe this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach problem-solving and create meaningful impact across industries. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise to build intelligent and scalable applications while constantly expanding my knowledge in AI technologies. ðŸ¤–
